# Review 1

* [x] Please check carefully the meaning of ,,resolution\'\' and conclude if this term should be used in your paper. In the introduction explain what you mean by ,,functional redundancy\'\' (give clear definition).
  * Geklärt. Ist gängiger Begriff.

# Review 2

* The variables FE e FD are not clear in equations 2 and 3. Index E and D are the same.

* [x] The text (0) in equation 3 is not clear. The variable should be presented in the text as they are presented.
  * Satz zu Indizes für Referenz-KS der Vektoren und Rotationsmatrizen

* [x] The pose \"x\" and the remaining variables are presented after equation 6, I suggest present them before, as soon as they are presented in equation1 and 2.
  * erledigt. Text umgestellt.

* [x] The identification and concept of the \"residual vector\" are not clear.
  * Erklärung dazu und des Begriffs deutlicher und früher

* [x] The definition of the vector \"alpha\", in the begin of section 2.2 it is different from presented in Equation 10, where is presented the vector \"alpha*\".
  * Satz dazu ergänzt

* [x] In the text, it is said that \"alpha\" is reciprocal Euler angles. It is not clear in what sense such reciprocity emerges.
  * Klargestellt: Reziprozität bezieht sich auf die Kombination zweier Euler-Winkel.

* [N] The authors said \"degree of freedom which can be set arbitrarily\". If I consider that the last angle is arbitrary, thus I do not have a problem with redundancies. Please review this sentence and make it clear.
  * Zusatz: DoF of Operational Space
  * Review-Kommentar geht am Inhalt vorbei: Die Redundanz ist kein Problem, sondern etwas, was man mathematisch bestmöglich beschreiben möchte, um es auszunutzen.

* The matrix \"P\"psi\" in Equation 21 is different from the \"P\"n\" in equation 14. It is not clear.

* The term \"regarded\", is not used, as well as several words along the text. Please use scientific writing.

* [x] Equation 27 shows the transpose of R matrix. The \"T\" identification, for transposition, should be added.
  * Stapel-Operator noch ausführlicher und konkret auf Rotationsmatrizen erklärt. Mehr auf Dimensionen eingegangen.

* [x] In equation 30 is not mentioned anything about the second solution for the angles.
  * Hinweis zu arctan2

* [N] Maybe a numerical development in this paper could make clear the contributions and how can be used the proposes reciprocal Euler approach.
  * Dafür ist kein Platz
